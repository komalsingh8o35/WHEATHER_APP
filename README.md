# WEATHER_APP
Building a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fantastic project that combines web development skills with practical application.
When building a weather app, I encounter several interesting challenges and learning opportunities, such as:

Handling API keys securely:- Ensuring API key is not exposed publicly.

Responsive design:- Making sure the app looks good on various devices and screen sizes.

Error handling:- Providing user feedback for incorrect input or network issues.

Dynamic updates:- Ensuring that data updates in real-time and without page reloads.

Working on this project will provide practical experience with front-end web development and API integration.
Plus, I'll end up with a useful tool to check the weather!
